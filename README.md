# A Blockchain Based Approach to Digitalize Health Sector for Better Transparency, Privacy and Security

> Team Name: Spondon

> Project Type: HealthTech

Healthcare currently occupies the top position in any economy in the world. However, it is a diverse and data-intensive field. The security of data is a big deal. Today’s healthcare data management systems are facing key challenges in terms of data transparency, traceability, immutability, trust, data provenance, flexible access, privacy, and security. Routinely collected data are being underused due to poor data quality, mismatch of the regular data, irregular updating, and lack of user-friendly approach to access data. Blockchain is an emerging and disruptive decentralized technology that has the potential to significantly revolutionize, reshape, and transform the way data is being handled in healthcare industries. We have proposed a solution to control these problems using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain that creates a way for digitization of medical records such as patient data, and interoperability issues providing a unique patient identifier that can be universally recognizable. This unique identifier can make the industry’s shift to electronic records faster and easier, preventing mismatches in data that is transferred between healthcare systems.

## Current Scenario

Bangladesh, a south Asian fast-growing economic country, has experienced a demographic and epidemiological transition with rapid urbanization and a gradual increase in life expectancy. One glaring problem is seen in the healthcare sector. The outcomes of a surgical or nonsurgical medical procedure depend on an accurate diagnosis of the disease, which is primarily contingent on taking proper history and physical examination of the patient. Bangladesh does not have a formal body for arbitration of complaints against health care providers. Hospital or clinic authorities address complaints and disputes independently, without involving the government or legal entities. “Oversight of physicians” and “inappropriate treatment” have become commonly-used phrases in print and electronic media of Bangladesh, while violence against the physician in Bangladesh (by patients or by their associates) has increased, and the severity has also intensified simultaneously.

According to data collected from BIDA, the Bangladesh healthcare sector has been analyzed. In Bangladesh, the popular methods of providing medical service are through hospitals and clinics as well as diagnostic centers. The CAGR for the healthcare industry is 10.3% and counting from 2010, in terms of monetary value, the peak of the healthcare industry has reached USD 6.76 billion in 2018.

Presently, there is another problem that is very prevalent in the healthcare sector. The trust of the patients with the doctor has diminished due to the increase in medical negligence. Medical negligence may occur voluntarily or involuntarily but either way results in devastating losses for patients and in increasing distrust towards the healthcare sector. Medical malpractice is another phenomenon commonly seen which occurs due to the medical professional not taking adequate measures of treatment. Although such an act is related directly to the life of a patient, such an act is a common practice in Bangladesh. The news of deaths due to medical occurrences is commonly seen and no lawful acts are not brought under it. Mostly due to the malpractice not being traceable and lacking sufficient evidence. Even if it were traceable, there is no particular act that addresses actions behind medical negligence in Bangladesh. Under the jurisdiction of Tort, Criminal, and Constitutional laws, this must be vindicated.

Another trend is seen due to the large population and decentralized healthcare system. The rural areas of the country are often deprived of proper healthcare. Government has taken steps to bridge this gap by setting up many government-funded hospitals at low cost, but they are also very often underfunded and lack experienced medical staff members. Thus, the patients are often directed to word-of-mouth treatments of which no record is kept. There is simply no recordkeeping that is done to address rural areas that often do not have proper healthcare facilities. To remedy this, the national government has set up many government-funded hospitals in rural areas that provide cheaper treatment for rural citizens. However, these hospitals are often poorly funded, understaffed, and overly crowded due to a limited number of healthcare options in rural areas.

According to data from 2013 where data was collected from newspaper articles, it was found that 29 cases of wrong treatment have been reported of which, 27 led to death cases. 7 of those cases occurred due to negligence and others due to fraud of medical professionals. Data from BSEHR, the death toll from mistreatment amounted to 122, 104, 65, and 69 in the respective years between 2014 to 2017.

Growing demand for e-healthcare services and integrated-care delivery, coupled with an increased focus on member-health management, accentuates the need for an information technology system that can remove dependency on middlemen. Blockchain can help overcome most, if not all, of these challenges- Fragmented Data, Timely Access to Patient Data, System Interoperability, Data Security, Patient-Generated Data, Access and Data Inconsistency, Cost-effectiveness, and Wrong Prescription.

## Problem Identification

1. **Lack of unified data/history storage system**

Patients sometimes shift their doctor schedules. When they go to a new doctor, the new doctor doesn’t know about the treatment procedure of the former one. The doctor needs to investigate again. And without knowing the past treatment history of the patient, the new doctor cannot ensure proper treatment. This problem can be solved by prescription details with the patient data history. The previous prescription will help a doctor to observe a patient correctly.

2. **Risk of data tempering for digital and analog systems and cyber-attack for digitalized systems**

Data tampering is a major concern for organizations everywhere. With personal health information on the line, healthcare organizations are particularly concerned, because it can be extraordinarily disruptive if patient data finds its way into the wrong hands. Moreover, ransomware that holds servers with patient data hostage could potentially compromise care.

3. **Risk of fraud and counterfeiting**

In health care, fraud can be committed by medical providers, patients and who intentionally deceive the health care system to receive unlawful benefits or payments. Medical providers commit fraud in billing by submitting multiple claims and bills for the same service. Bogus marketing fraud, identity theft and impersonating a healthcare professional kinds of frauds are committed by Medical Providers. Forgery, diversion and doctor shopping are the frauds involving prescription.

4. **Lack of fast verification process**

Prior to visa interview one must have a medical examination performed by a medical doctor authorized by the Embassy. Normally this process of getting medical clearance  takes 3 weeks to 120 days which is a very long time . 

5. **Identification of patience negligence in sharing data**

A lot of medicine that is bought is unprescribed. And even some of the medicines that are given have no record due to negligence on the end of both the healthcare professionals as well as the patients. So, in many medical emergencies, it is seen that the patients are not able to provide the necessary medical history documents and thus fall victim to mistreatment which in certain cases even the doctor has no-fault.

6. **Identification of doctor or medical malpractice**

There is an obvious lack of accountability among the healthcare professionals which is the main reason for medical malpractice. There is no legislation to hold medical professionals accountable for medical malpractice. There is often news about the occurrence of medical malpractice, but people are unwilling to take any action due to the lack of knowledge required to bring the malpractices to justice.

7. **Healthcare System is Pluralized**

There are multiple factions working simultaneously to provide healthcare facilities. Some have been funded properly some are not. And most are understaffed. This leads to mistreatment of patients and imbalanced prioritization for treatment on the basis of social class.

## Solutions

Whether or not the blockchain is the suitable technology to tackle these problems will be answered by these three questions :

1. Will the use of Blockchain technology improve the health sector’s current system?

2. How does it work as prescription transparency for doctors and patients?

3. Is this possible to implement in the current health system in Bangladesh?

Blockchain technology provides a decentralized and distributed healthcare system. 

Decentralized storage: Blockchain stores the information, which is transparent and delivered to third parties based on the consent of the creator. A decentralized way of storing the information is keeping multiple copies of that information in multiple places.

Consent: access, storage, and distribution will be controlled by the global consensus algorithm. After an autonomous sanction from all available parties, the changes are allowed to be made to the data.

Immutability: In our current general system, the stored data can easily be edited or deleted. But Blockchain has decentralized data and it is distributed to all the existing users. So, no one can tamper with the data of records. In this portion, blockchain solved the immutability issue. alteration of any data is impossible. Once data is stored in a particular block, it can never be changed or modified.

Disintermediation: Removes third-party intervention and the data manipulation rate is reduced.

Security: Healthcare’s traditional servers are basically centralized and can be attacked by hackers or not much trusted. Decentralization via blockchain increases the difficulty to be attacked. In the blockchain, the data is securely hashed on a block. And all the blocks are connected to the chain. And it is distributed to all of the users as a copy of data. If someone tries to tamper with any of the data, he needs to change every single node to do this. It is hard to break. Therefore, Blockchain can secure the data from tampering.

Redundancy: Healthcare systems have some sensible data and there is a possibility of losing that data forever. If this happens, it is the worst situation at that time for anyone. Blockchain gives the data redundancy. It basically has the same data distributed to all the users.

Increased capacity: With no middleman and fewer apps.

The blockchain-based model gives the healthcare market a new dimension by considering safety aspects for data integrity and developing standardized and formalized contracts for accessing the data. When we work with EHRs, which store the data with a different workflow, it is difficult to know the identity of the person who does what and when the work has been performed. The blockchain-based model puts a timestamp on every workflow and also puts an identity to it and the copies are distributed to each participating node in the network. So, if there is a modification or update in any node, it is equally distributed to all the nodes and is visible to everybody accessing it anywhere in the world. The model ensures that the data integrity is maintained between the endpoints without any human intervention.

## Architecture

The given figure (in the next page) shows a high-level overview of the architecture of our system. The blockchain admin configures the initial network configurations of our Hyperledger fabric network and gives credentials and necessary access to DGHS who govern the system. All the hospitals/diagnostic centers are connected with each other in “Channel I”. Hospital & Law Enforcement Agencies are connected with each other via “Channel II” for the data that is shared by patients. The peers from each hospital are docker containers of the images of fabric-peer, orderer, and CA and each peer has a copy of the ledger and smart contracts deployed in them. CouchDB is used to store patient medical records data and other assets. A webserver is written in Nodejs with express js used to invoke and query the smart contracts and to provide the necessary APIs to communicate with the web client. Web clients are the Hospital admin dashboard, Patient dashboard, doctor dashboard, and document verification portal which use the REST APIs.

### Choice of blockchain

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger, etc are some of the blockchain platforms that have been developed over the years. We will use Hyperledger Fabric to implement our solution which is a permissioned and closed blockchain, no person can get added to the network unlike permissionless blockchains such as bitcoin, and Ethereum. This solves the confidentiality problem of patients’ data.  The fabric has a common Certificate Authority (Fabric CA) for every organization and MSP which provides identities and verifies when a transaction request is made.  Moreover, all the components of the fabric network are scalable and pluggable. It means more organizations can be added to any channel. The initial organizations who have the control of channel configurations decide whether a new organization should be added to the channel or not. Like Ethereum, the fabric also provides the concept of smart contracts, and when it is packaged and deployed it is called Chaincode. Chaincode is a business logic that is deployed on every endorsing peer.

### Integration with legacy process and systems

Currently, most hospitals and medical organizations have their own electrical health record system to manage medical records and other patient-related information. But this EHR is not shared among the organization. All the hospitals and diagnostic centers will enroll as an organization in the fabric network. Patient data i.e prescription, payslip, test-report data, etc. will be the assets that will be stored in the ledger. As a result, any doctor can view patient medical history when a patient grants access to his medical data to the doctor. A patient can update his personal data but can’t update any medical data. Fabric network includes law enforcement agencies for shared data history. It will help detect mistreatment/patient negligence.

### Tokenization![](https://i.ibb.co/zfk702f/Tokenization.jpg)

The tokenization concept is taken from ‘Blockchain: Securing a new health interoperability experience’ (2016), which was presented and discusses how blockchain technology could assist patient health care data interoperability 

### Web clients

![](https://i.ibb.co/DKV7yH5/Use-Case.jpg)

- Hospital/Diagnostic center admin dashboard(requires login): can register doctors and patients by verifying their identity using porichoy API, view patient data with minimal information, appoint a doctor to the patient, and add payment slips for patients.

- Patient dashboard(requires login): can view personal details, treatment history i.e. prescription, payment slip, test report, etc, edit the personal details, grant/revoke access to his/her medical history a doctor

- Doctor dashboard(requires login): can view personal details and the patient's medical history that is shared with him, and add a new treatment for the patient.

- Document verification portal: can verify any document i.e prescription, payment slip, test report, etc. The portal can be also used to verify and find the share date of a document that is granted share access to a hospital/doctor.

- DGHS Dashboard(requires login): can generate statistical data from the shared data(disease, time, location) without disclosing the patient's identity. For example - Daily/weekly reports on Dengue-affected people in different areas, Daily/weekly reports on Covid19 affected people, etc.

## Governance

### Network Membership Governance

- Member on and off boarding: Director General of Health Service (DGHS) will start the network as an orderer and a channel will be created with some hospitals which have the control of the channel configurations. All the hospitals and diagnostic centers will gradually be added to the channel by agreeing on the network and channel policies.

- Data ownership structure: Patient has full control of their data. They can grant and revoke access of the data to the doctors and the authority in the network they want. Only a partial amount of data is shared with DGHS to generate the statistics without disclosing the patient's identity. 

- Regulatory oversight provisioning: DGHS along with the Directorate General of Family Planning(DGFP) are the regulators of the fabric network. The ordering service is controlled by the regulators and resolves any conflicts and data inconsistency.

- Permission Structure: Patients grant access to their appointed doctors for treatment. After the treatment is complete, the patient can revoke permission from the doctors. Hospital admin and Diagnostic centers only have access to the basic information of the patient, for example, patient id, name, age, etc. DGHS will be permitted to access information like disease, treatment, age range, location, etc for generating statistical data protecting the privacy of patients.

- Service Level Agreement(SLA) management: Network members should share the expected data that all members agree on. In case, any member fails to follow the agreement and network policies the regulators can take action against them.

### Business Network Governance

- Business SLA Management: The hospital or diagnostic center and the patient all agree to share data between both parties which is stated throughout the agreement. The uptime provided hopefully will be around 99% and in case of any problems, the call metrics queue time will be less than 5 minutes. For customer satisfaction, there will be an information desk present in every Upazila level. In case of any failure, we expect less than two minutes to turn around. And for any incidents, the meantime to recovery might need from 10 minutes to 30 minutes depending on the scenario. And if any party declines to follow the agreement the regulators can take actions agreed by the party beforehand.

- Business Operations Structure: Hospitals that sign up for the system shall continue their regular operations according to previous agreements. But in addition to that, they need to provide only the information exchanged between the parties. The information provided can’t be shared by the hospital authorities without the patient's permission. As the regulations stay the same as before there are no further motives.

- Collective Representation: The hospitals will be regulated by DGHS and DGFP. They need to follow patient-doctor confidentiality. And the patient is the owner of data and they can prove the validity of the data by providers or regulators.

- Business exchange conditions management: All documents shared under the network will comply with patient confidentiality. One has control over his data in terms of sharing with others. A small portion of data  will be shared anonymously for analytical and statistical purposes.

- Network charter and management: A committee will be formed on Network Operations and Management with a focus on network and service operation and management. Their area of interest will include real-time management and automation of networks, customer network management and control, service management, networking decision and architecture, etc.

### Technology Infrastructure Governance

- Distributed IT Management Infrastructure: The ledger is distributed among all peers nodes. The organization i.e hospitals and diagnostic centers that manage the peer will also bear the cost of running the IT infrastructure needed to keep the peer online. The whole network will be hosted by a renowned cloud service provider.

- Framework for utilizing industry-standard: Hyperledger fabric is currently known as the best enterprise-grade blockchain framework. It is an open-source framework that has a modular architecture driven by the consortium and it provides secure and trusted communication which is a key characteristic for enterprise use. So Hyperledger fabric is chosen as the framework to develop the network.

- Technology Assessment and Adoption: A board of technical experts will be formed with representatives from various entities. They will periodically discuss new improvements and standards in the industries, and security measures, and agree to standards to enforce on the system. They are approved by DGHS. The standards will be enforced with the help of network configurations.

- Data Entry: Points of data entry are very crucial as it determines core points of failure for any secure blockchain. Our data sources are - 1. Test report & payment slip from diagnostic centers and hospitals 2. A medical prescription from doctors. They are verified from DGHS. This ensures that at each point of data entry participants either don’t have the ability or incentive to cheat the system.

- Data On-Off Chain: Documents, patients, and providers are recorded off-chain with their hashes embedded in each block with a timestamp and digital signatures. Actual medical record files are kept out of the blockchain.

## Market

The target market for the inclusion of this project is primarily the patients. However, we will not target the patients directly. Instead, fundamentally our target would be the medical service providing facilities. The decentralized nature of the healthcare industry has led the private sector to dominate this field with the high growth in a number of hospitals and diagnostic centers. Marking the end of 2019, the number of public hospitals was 255 and the number of private hospitals rose to 5,054 along with a total diagnostic center registered to be 9,529. The total hospital beds that can accommodate patients including both public and private facilities amounted to 143,394 at the end of 2019. Our vision is to bring the people in Bangladesh into the vicinity of blockchain healthcare documentation. This will be a lengthy process and thus we have fundamentally targeted our market to be the medical facilities through which the patients can be easily targeted.

## Partner

![](https://i.ibb.co/VpRT8ZM/Block-Chain-partners-01.png)

## Competition

The instances of blockchain application in Bangladesh have fundamentally been dominated in the financial sector. Even that has been proven on a smaller scale. Bangladesh is still negligent towards the application of blockchain technology. Not only that, but it also lacks the technological advancement, or the regulation required to do so.

The closest usage of blockchain technology in the healthcare sector has been seen by IBM. IBM has enforced blockchain technology in the application of vaccines. One major caveat with vaccines was the lack of trust. In this case, IBM with their blockchain ensured that the vaccine distribution process was entirely documented and that from the start to finish, the process was traceable. This induced trust.

In Bangladesh, addressing the challenges, it will be an open market for the inclusion of blockchain in the healthcare sector.

## Risk Analysis

The application and inclusion of blockchain in the healthcare system of Bangladesh will come with its own set of risks that must be addressed. The feasibility in this regard will depend fundamentally on getting the partners on board and striving towards technological and policy readiness of the governance of the country.

Health data has the ability to result in a large number of transactions which can happen very fast. The speed at which information is transferred may become the matter of life and death. So, the foundation of technology that supports this project will be a big risk. Moreover, depending on the success of the pilot plan and the general acceptance, scalability might also be risky territory. The proper implementation of this project requires blockchain technology to record all medical transactions. So, acceptability among the general people will be required for scaling the project and this by itself will be a risk. Implementation of private blockchains has the potential to maintain the transaction speed and maintain better control.

There is also the matter of confidentiality and transparency of information. It can be a challenge to gain acceptability among the general population knowing their information may be transparent if the entire process is not manually learned.

Finally, it must be kept into consideration that the blockchain technology arena is still under constant improvement and hence there can be many solutions that arise to address the implementation stage risks.

## Value Proposition

The fundamental idea behind our project is that the Medical history of patients will be stored in blockchain privately. The patient also has the authority to decide which information to make public and which to not. This will add value to 2 separate parties.

**To the Patients**: They will be ensured that any medical services they receive will be recorded and thus the doctors will be accountable for any malpractice. Patients have the authority to decide which information they want to be public and which to not. Having possession of a blockchain that contains all medical records will make transactions easier. For example, during immigration, or any legal documentation requires medical documents. Having this blockchain record will simplify the transaction process.

**To the healthcare staff**: The medical history of the patient can be used by doctors such that the case of mistreatment due to missing medical history does not occur. Doctors can provide better informed medical treatment after assessing the medical history of the patient.

**To the law enforcement agency**: They will have all the shared hashed records. So, they do not know what data is shared but can verify whether the data was shared between two parties without having access to the data . This process can help in  determining mistreatment or patient negligence
